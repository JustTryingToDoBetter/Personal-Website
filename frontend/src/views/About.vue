      Hello! I'm Jaydin Morrison, a software engineer based in Cape Town. I
      specialise in building modern web applications with a focus on
      performance, accessibility and delightful user experiences. With a
      background in both backend and frontend development, I enjoy creating
      end‑to‑end solutions that solve real problems.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      When I'm not coding you can find me hiking in the mountains, exploring
      the local coffee scene or learning about new technologies. Feel free to
      check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
